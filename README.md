# Biophysical model of a cell-free gluconate responsive biosensor

### Introduction
This repository contains code written in the [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) programming language for the cell-free gluconate responsive biosensor described in the publication: 

[Adhikari et al (2023) Modeling and Analysis of a Cell-Free Gluconate Responsive Biosensor (bioRxiv)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.10.523462v1.full)


### Installation and Requirements

To get the model codes, you can download this model repository as a zip file, clone or pull it using the command:

	git pull https://github.com/varnerlab/Gluconate-biophysical-modeling-code

or

	git clone https://github.com/varnerlab/Gluconate-biophysical-modeling-code

The ``src`` directory contains the code for the model.

### Scripts
Each model subdirectory contains scripts to solve or analyze the model equations:

Script | Description
---: | ---
``Parameter_estimation_W_splined.jl`` | Solves the model equations for the ensemble of parameters sets for the test case, 10mM gluconate. Saves solutions in the ``poets_ensemble_W`` directory
``Gluconate_dynamics_automated.jl`` | Uses the parameter ensemble generated by ``Parameter_estimation_W_splined.jl`` script to simulate the TX/TL dynamics for varying gluconate concentrations. Saves the solutions in the ``gluconate_dynamics`` directory. Subdirectories within ``gluconate_dynamics`` hold solutions for each specified gluconate concentration
``prot-venus-plot_automated.jl``, ``prot-GNTR-plot.jl``, ``mrna-venus-plot.jl``, ``mrna-gntr-plot.jl`` | Plot the TX/TL dynamics generated by the ``Gluconate_dynamics_automated.jl`` script. Plots are saved in ``gluconate_dynamics/plots`` directory
``dose_response_ensemble.jl`` | Solves the model equations to generate the dose response curve. Results are saved in the ``dose_response_simulations`` directory
 ``dose_response_plot_edited.jl`` | Plots the dose response curve from the simulations generated by the ``dose_response_ensemble.jl`` script and saves the figure in the ``dose_response_simulations`` directory
``sensitivity-gntr-gluconate-updated.jl`` | Conducts [Morris sensitivity analysis](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1269043) on the model
``sensitivity-gntr-gluconate-updated.jl`` | Conducts [Morris sensitivity analysis](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1269043) on the model and saves the results in the ``sensitivity_results`` directory
``sensitivity_results.jl`` | Plots the sensitivity matrix and saves the plot
